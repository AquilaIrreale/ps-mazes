# PostScript mazes

If you ever yearned for an endless source of A4-sized mazes, look no
further.

These documents should work properly with most document viewers. Be
warned though: they like to change. You get a fresh maze every time you
open one. Or print it. Or change the zoom level, probably, depending on
your viewer. Basically, if you see a maze you really really like, be
quick, save it to a PDF file there and then! Or you are never going to
get the same one ever again.
